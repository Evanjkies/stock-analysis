# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
The original goal of this project was to establish a macro that would pull from a listing of stocks and the volumes traded associated with each one, and would aggregate those amounts as well as list the overall returns on a per stock basis. Once a functional macro was established the new goal was to take a macro that was already established as functional, and refactor it to the point where it would have an easier time if were ever to be applied to a larger group of stocks and subsequent data.
